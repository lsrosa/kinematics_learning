## Kinematics Learning

# Forward Kinematics
Creates a Forward Kinematics (FK) model for serial robotic manipulators. The architecture consists of a FK model encoding the DH transformation for each link w.r.t. the previous link, which are chained together to compute the FK w.r.t. the world reference frame.
